Hennepin County prosecutors charged Bogdan Vechirko , of Otsego , with making threats of violence , a felony , and criminal vehicular operation , a gross misdemeanor , the Star Tribune reported . Prosecutors allege that he sought to `` scare '' protesters out of his path and could have seen them with plenty of time to stop before his truck reached them . Vechirko , 35 , drove onto the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River as thousands of people protested the death of Floyd , who died six days earlier in the custody of Minneapolis police .  Nobody was seriously hurt , though criminal complaint says at least <extra_id_99> one protester suffered abrasions as she jumped to get out of the truck 's path . Vechirko told investigators he was returning from a fuel delivery in Minneapolis and did n't mean to drive into the protest or hurt anyone . Authorities had closed area highways as a precaution , but traffic camera video showed that the trucker entered the downtown freeway system from a ramp that was n't barricaded , for reasons that remain unclear . When Vechirko saw the crowd on the bridge , he `` relied on his professional instinct and training to avoid a hard brake that could have jackknifed the truck and could have seriously injured or killed thousands of people , and instead slowed his vehicle while maneuvering through the parted crowd , '' his attorney Mark Solheim , told the newspaper . title: Trucker who drove through George Floyd protesters is charged	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> Minnesota Minneapolis </s>

'' Based on social media video , an individual in the crowd appears to have pointed a handgun at Vechirko and to have discharged two rounds into the tractor 's front tire , Solheim said .

Marchers and protesters have honored Floyd , as well Breonna Taylor , a Black woman who was shot and killed by Louisville police after they entered her home while she was sleeping . Protesters are also remembering local Black people killed by police , like Antwon Rose II , a 17-year-old who was shot and killed by police in 2018 in East Pittsburgh as he was fleeing .

Allegheny County Councilors , even Democrats , are still largely backing police priorities over the demands of advocates .

California has lost far more landscape to wildfires this summer than during any previous entire year , with scores of conflagrations , many sparked by catastrophic lightning storms , scorching about 3.4 million acres since mid-August . The previous record was just less than 2 million acres burned in 2018 .  As of Monday , more than <extra_id_99> 19,000 firefighters continued to wage war on 27 major blazes across the state , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -LRB- CalFire -RRB- .

Another 2 million acres have gone up in flames in Oregon and Washington state during an overlapping outbreak of wildfires that started earlier this month , destroying more than 4,400 structures in all and claiming 10 lives . But a weekend of intermittently heavy showers across the western Cascade mountain range helped fire crews in the Pacific Northwest tamp down blazes in those two states . title: California Firefighters Race to Subdue Flames Before Heat, Winds Return	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

But Newsom dropped the fiery tone he has employed in recent weeks about climate change and its role in <extra_id_99> five of the largest fires California has ever seen . Instead , he engaged the president in a respectful conversation that included both men hailing their good relationship . Just last week , Newsom declared he had `` no patience for climate-change deniers , '' saying people must `` disabuse ourselves of all the BS that 's being spewed by a very small group of people .

As crews battled wildfires that have killed at least 35 people , destroyed neighborhoods and enveloped the West Coast in smoke , Trump contended that the states are to blame for failing to rake leaves and clear dead timber from forest floors . However , many of the California blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands , not forest , and some of the largest are burning on federal land . In Oregon , it was the forests that burned at unprecedented levels this past week .  Almost the same number of `` megafires '' -- defined as having scorched <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres or more -- were burning last week as have occurred during the entire last century , said Jim Gersbach , spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry . Experts , environmentalists and loggers largely agree that thinning trees and brush through prescribed burns and careful logging will help prevent forests that cover vast tracts of the American West from threatening cities with fire . But whether that would have spared towns is less clear . Strong winds sent flames racing down the western slopes of the Cascade Range into small towns like Detroit , Oregon , wiping them out . title: Easing fires not as simple as climate change vs. forest work	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> Oregon <extra_id_4> </s>

PORTLAND , Ore. ( Reuters ) - Firefighters took advantage of a welcome break in hot , dry weather on Saturday to make gains against massive wildfires burning across three western states as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would travel to California to see the devastation first-hand .

The latest threats came amid what meteorologists called the strongest onslaught of extreme winds - and lowest humidity levels - yet documented during an already epic California wildfire season ranked as the worst on record in terms of acreage burned . Fires have scorched more than 6,400 square miles ( 16,500 square kilometres ) - equivalent to the land mass of the state of Hawaii - since the start of the year , with thousands of homes destroyed and 31 lives lost . Red flag warnings for incendiary weather conditions remained in place across much of California due to winds gusting in excess of 80 miles per hour ( 129 kph ) , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .  Illustrating the hazards posed by California 's latest bout of desert-born winds , a blaze dubbed the Silverado fire erupted early Monday and spread across <extra_id_99> 7,200 acres -LRB- 2,913 hectares -RRB- of Orange County by late afternoon , county fire authority spokesman Thanh Nguyen told Reuters .

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- The USDA Forest Service , Pacific Southwest Region , and the National Interagency Fire Center have coordinated with the Department of Defense for the deployment of approximately 200 soldiers plus command staff to help with wildfire suppression efforts in Northern California . The soldiers are due to arrive early this week from the 14th Brigade Engineer Battalion , 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team , 2nd Infantry Division , I Corps , from Joint Base Lewis-McChord , Washington . The soldiers will be deployed on the August Complex on the Mendocino National Forest after conducting additional ground training and fireline certification .  The August Complex started on August 17 , 2020 , from <extra_id_99> 37 different lightning fires . Many of those fires have been contained or have merged to form larger fires . As of Monday night , the Complex was 236,288 acres and 20-percent contained . `` This support will provide additional capacity to ensure firefighting resources are available to respond to ongoing and emerging wildfires in California , '' said Randy Moore , regional forester for the Pacific Southwest Region . title: Military to support August Complex operations	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

1 of 3 BOISE , Idaho -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often crews are forced to use them during wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate .

They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees of heat for about a minute . The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure . The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said . title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives but raise questions	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> <extra_id_4> </s> </s>

By contrast , in the past few years California intentionally burned roughly 50 thousand acres on public lands . In fact , a study published in the journal Fire showed that prescribed burns on federal lands in the West over the past 20 years stayed flat or fell despite ongoing calls to do much more . ` Losing this battle every year ' Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) was the only federal agency to substantially increase prescribed fire use , the study said , likely due to tribal self-governance and a historic embrace of intentional fire .  Federal and California officials recently signed an agreement to try boost that significantly : the new goal is to treat about <extra_id_99> 1 million acres a year with combined thinning and controlled burns . But experts warn that states continue to set ambitions prescribed fire goals they never reach .

It would be exorbitantly expensive to build enough power plants to ensure the electricity never goes off -- and some of those plants might sit idle for years at a time . So instead , the U.S. utility industry has long followed a standard of having enough power on call to ensure this type of outage does n't happen more than once every 10 years . The last time California was forced to implement rotating blackouts because of insufficient energy supply was nearly 20 years ago , during the 2001 energy crisis , as opposed to more recent intentional outages because of fire safety .  But these blackouts may strike a raw nerve for many PG&E customers after the utility 's decision last year to shut down power to <extra_id_99> millions of people in an effort to prevent its aging and poorly maintained transmission lines from igniting wildfires . In a letter to his own top energy officials Monday , Gov. Gavin Newsom described the blackouts as `` unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation 's largest and most innovative state . '' He instructed them to investigate what had gone wrong and take several steps to better prepare for future heat waves . title: California blackouts are Public Utilities Commission's fault, grid operator says	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

Homeowners in fire-prone areas of California have had it rough in recent years . Not only have they been threatened by gigantic , climate-change-fueled wildfires , but their insurance premiums have skyrocketed -- if they have n't been dumped by insurers worried about huge claims from the blazes that will inevitably come .  Over the course of four particularly bad fire years , from 2015 to 2018 , more than <extra_id_99> 340,000 homeowners in rural areas were told by insurers their policies would not be renewed , according to the California Department of Insurance . Those unable to find another insurance company willing to write a new policy have been left with the high-cost option of last resort , the California FAIR plan . It 's a bad situation -- and it could get even worse if lawmakers approve Assembly Bill 2167 , a legislative `` fix '' championed by the insurance industry that purports to improve coverage in areas of high fire risk . But the only thing that 's likely to improve under these proposed changes is the bottom line of insurance companies , say California 's Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara and consumer advocates , including the author of Proposition 103 , the landmark consumer protection law regulating property and casualty insurance rates in California . title: Guest Editorial: An insurance fix that only insurers could love	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

By stamping out smaller fires and those that ignite during wetter months , Stahl said officials have allowed fuels to build up , setting the stage for bigger fires during times of drought and hot , windy weather . That 's been exacerbated this year by the coronavirus pandemic , which prompted U.S. Forest Service Chief Vickie Christiansen to issue a directive in June to fight all fires aggressively , reversing a decades-long trend of allowing some to burn . The idea was to minimize large concentrations of firefighters by extinguishing blazes quickly .  Fighting the flames from the air was key to the strategy , with <extra_id_99> 35 air tankers and 200 helicopters being used , Forest Service spokesperson Kaari Carpenter said . Yet by Aug. 30 , following the deaths of some firefighters , including four aviators , and several close calls , fire officials in Boise warned that long-term fatigue was setting in . They called for a `` tactical pause '' so fire commanders could reinforce safe practices . Tim Ingalsbee , a member of the advocacy group Firefighters United for Safety , Ethics and Ecology , said the June directive from Christiansen returned the forest service to a mindset prevalent for much of the last century that focused on putting out fires as quickly as possible . title: Taxed resources still fight western fires	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

Even in areas that are untouched by the fires themselves , the rippling effects of these fires can and have been felt far and wide . California 's wildfire season has caused increased pollutants that raise the Air Quality Index in past years , such as the Kincaide fire of 2019 , which caused AQI levels of 150 or more . However , the combination of fires this year , both in state and out of state , have sparked unprecedented highs .  Many areas are averaging an AQI of <extra_id_99> 200 , and several areas , such as Sacramento , are reaching numbers of 400 or higher . According to Airnow , a government partner of the EPA dedicated to monitoring Air Quality , 200 + AQI is classified as `` Very Unhealthy '' and they warn that the chance for adverse health effects from exposure is higher for everyone .

WASHINGTON -- The number of wildfires and the amount of land they consume in the western U.S. has substantially increased since the 1980s , a trend often attributed to ongoing climate change . Now , new research finds fires are not only becoming more common in the western U.S. but the area burned at high severity is also increasing , a trend that may lead to long-term forest loss . The new findings show warmer temperatures and drier conditions are driving an eight-fold increase in annual area burned by high severity fire across western forests from 1985-2017 .  In total , annual area burned by high severity wildfires -- defined as those that kill more than 95 % of trees -- increased by more than <extra_id_99> 450,000 acres . `` As more area burns at high severity , the likelihood of conversion to different forest types or even to non-forest increases , '' said Sean Parks , a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station and lead author of the new study . `` At the same time , the post-fire climate is making it increasingly difficult for seedlings to establish and survive , further reducing the potential for forests to return to their pre-fire condition .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) - Investigations found that damaged electrical equipment ignited two Southern California wildfires last year , including one that threatened the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum , a fire agency said Thursday . The investigative results for two fires that broke out northwest of Los Angeles a year ago were released as power cuts were underway in parts of Northern California to prevent electrical equipment from igniting fires amid gusty , dry weather .  The <extra_id_99> 1,800-acre Easy Fire , which threatened the library and nearby Simi Valley homes , ignited Oct. 30 , 2019 , when an insulator attached to a Southern California Edison high-voltage transmission line swung into a steel power pole during windy , dry conditions , the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement . At the time , the utility reported to state regulators that its equipment may have been involved in the fire , which damaged two buildings . The Ventura County department also said the Maria Fire near Santa Paula was ignited the next day by failure of a conductor on an electrical distribution line owned by California Resources Corp. `` Fire investigators found that an electrical conductor separated and contacted a metal pipe on the ground , igniting the fire , '' the department said . Nearly 15.6 square miles were scorched , and four buildings were damaged . title: 2 Southern California wildfires last year blamed on electrical lines	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California Simi Valley </s>

When UC San Diego and the University of Oregon became partners , the network became ALERTWildfire . The efficacy of the network to confirm and monitor wildfires was readily apparent and interagency investment created a surge in camera numbers as they quickly became an essential tool . In California , the ALERTWildfire network expansion began in 2017 with 16 cameras in San Diego County funded through San Diego Gas & Electric .  From there , additional investment and support to expand the network has come from organizations including Pacific Gas & Electric , Southern California Edison , and most recently CAL FIRE , which contributed $ <extra_id_99> 5 million for the installation and network support of 100 additional cameras throughout the state of California that were installed this spring , summer and fall in anticipation of a potentially dangerous 2020 fire season . `` The ALERTWildfire camera network provides actionable real-time data that allows first responders to marshal resources to fight fires in the incipient phase , '' said Scripps Oceanography geoscientist Neal Driscoll , director of the ALERTWildfire program at UC San Diego . `` These cameras save critical time by allowing rapid confirmation of 911 calls and accurate location of new fires using the ALERTWildfire web-based interface , time that would otherwise be spent sending engines to mountaintops or launching aircraft to confirm fire ignition and location .

The fires are `` stretching our resources , our personnel , '' the governor added . California 's fire department has issued various statements concerning the inadequate amount of people there are available to help fight the fires . `` All of our resources remain stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history , '' said Shana Jones , the chief for CalFire 's Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit .

The National Weather Service said `` lightning and gusty , erratic winds around storms will be the main threat '' for some communities , although the change in the wind 's direction does mean previously at-risk areas are now in the clear . `` As bad as that weather prediction is overall for certain parts of this fire , it actually is going to help us move it away from those certain communities , '' said Chief Mark Brunton , a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection , the state 's firefighting agency . The threat of the fires has in no way diminished yet though .  Two of the <extra_id_99> three main complexes , the LNU Lightning Complex and the SCU Lightning Complex , now rank as the second and third-largest on record in California 's history . The state 's largest fire in history is still the Mendocino Complex of 2018 -- for now . The blazes are not only straining California 's fire service but its public health service too .

About <extra_id_99> 13,700 firefighters are manning the lines , said Daniel Berlant , assistant deputy director for Cal Fire . Fire crews have been working around the clock and resources are drained . Only 1,400 firefighters were battling a blaze in California 's wine country , north of the San Francisco Bay .

Wildfire is threatening parts of the San Francisco Bay Area , the forested region near the University of California at Santa Cruz and a wide swath of the area between San Francisco and the state capital of Sacramento . On Saturday , President Donald Trump declared the fires to be a major disaster , the White House said . The declaration , which allows federal funds to be used to help people and businesses harmed by the fires in seven counties to pay for temporary housing , home repairs and other needs , came despite a threat from Trump earlier this week to withhold aid from California .  Nearly <extra_id_99> 14,000 firefighters have been deployed to the blazes , but containment of the largest ones remains low and the state has requested additional support from other states and local jurisdictions in California , Cal Fire said Saturday . `` They 're scrambling for bodies '' to help fight the fires , said Jay Tracy , a fire marshal with the city of Fresno who was deployed as a spokesman for the LNU fire complex , which had burned 314,000 acres in five counties , including some of the state 's storied wine country and communities between San Francisco and Sacramento . Firefighters have improved containment of the southern edge of that fire , but winds are expected to push it northwest toward the wine country towns of Healdsburg and Guernville , he said . Local agencies like his are limited in how many reinforcements they can send to help state firefighters because many are still needed at home , while the sheer volume of fires burning in the state have stretched resources , Tracy said . title: 14,000 Firefighters Deployed to Battle Growing, Lightning-Sparked NorCal Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West .

They are only the latest examples of what a half-dozen fire experts agreed is more extreme fire behavior driven by drought and warming temperatures they attribute to climate change . Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations .

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West . The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy , which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume , `` creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm , '' Flannigan said . The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus , which may or may not produce lightning , and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze .  An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented `` firenado , '' killing <extra_id_99> a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding . Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes , while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced `` a handful '' overnight Tuesday , said Neil Lareau , a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada , Reno .

Despite these intertwined issues of a pandemic and wildfires , only 17 out of the 114 wildfire segments on broadcast news in August , or 15 % , mentioned the pandemic . ABC and NBC aired six segments each , while CBS aired five . Another key storyline in coverage of the wildfires is California 's exploitative practice of using prison labor to fight them .  The state has relied on the use of prisoners to fight fires for decades , with over 3,000 inmates working at fire camps and roughly <extra_id_99> 2,200 serving as firefighters . These inmates are paid roughly $ 1 an hour , with some likening the practice to `` literally captive labor .

For starters , it 's based on state-specific data , whereas the Washington model primarily relies on data from Wuhan , China , where the first epidemic occurred , and also Italy and Spain , where COVID-19 also quickly reached epidemic levels , before arriving in the U.S. , erupting in a major outbreak in a Washington state nursing home owned by a Cleveland , Tennessee , nursing home chain . Noting China , Italy and Spain eventually cracked down with far more stringent actions than Tennessee has taken , Graves said the Vanderbilt model is fueled by Tennessee 's experiences and actions , which he said fall short of those three countries ' actions . Graves said the model relies on the shown rate of infection where aggressive measures to contain COVID-19 have n't been implemented .  Each infected person passes the virus on to <extra_id_99> five other people , who in turn do the same to others and so on down the chain . The professor said that in order to `` suppress '' the pandemic that spans much of the globe , a transmission number less than 1.0 `` must be sustained . '' In his presentation , Graves said many models assume a one-time change in the transmission number as a result of policy and/or behavioral changes . Because Vanderbilt 's model traces out the effective transmission number over time , the data evaluate the relative success of policy changes to date and predict hypothetical changes to the transmission number in the future . title: One Vanderbilt University COVID-19 model shows best-case Tennessee scenario is up to 3,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations	answer: <extra_id_4> </s> </s> </s> </s>
